Introduction:

A blog is a frequently updated online personal journal or diary. It is a place to express yourself to the world. A place to share your thoughts and your passions. Really, it’s anything you want it to be. For our purposes we’ll say that a blog is your own website that you are going to update on an ongoing basis. Blog is a short form for the word weblog and the two words are used interchangeably. Blogs range from the personal to the political, and can focus on one narrow subject or a whole range of subjects.It can also play an important role in student’s life. It can help in the promotion of critical and analytical thinking, increased access and exposure to quality content and a combination of solitary and social interactions with peers.

Currently student ts in schools or colleges are unable to express their ideas,
their talent or anything that can expressed for some benefits for everyone. The reason is, schools or colleges don’t have any proper medium to accomplish it.

But proposed online blogging system can help in accomplish these things and even much more. We will cover the objectives of this online blogging system in next section.I nternet has become reality and usage of internet become very much popular and there is tremendous increase of internet in all over the world for education al purpose.The Online Bloggin g System is easy to use, full-feat ured and much more.




Objective:

Online  Blogging System is a perfect platform for students, teachers, institutional administrative purposes.
The basic objective of developing this project is:

• To  promote  collaboration  between  students  and  teachers. Mutual  learning  between students and teachers.

• To  have  fun.  Yes,  you  heard  it  right.  It  is  wonderful  when  students  think  that  they  are having so much fun, they forget that they are actually learning.

• To increase motivation for re ading and writing.

• To   establish   a   home-school   or   home-college   connection   in   order   to   make   the
parents/guardians aware about  the happenings or events.

• To improve the writing and digital literacy of the students.



Project Scope:

The Online Blogging System will allow the users to publish the writings, if
he/she should without having credentials to login. The main users of this project are students, teachers and administrators.
From   an   end-user   perspective,   the   Online   Blogging   System   project   consists   of   following functional elements:

• Dashboard: It  is  the  default  page  of  the  site and  we  can  access  this  option  from  left hand side anytime. All links are available on this page. We can also find the Quick Draft
and Activity section here.

• Posts:Here we can see all the published contents by clicking on “All Posts
”option and we can also publish new content by “ Add New” option.
Add New” button.


Technologies Used

FRONT-END

HTML5- HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and latest major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation.
 CSS- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. CSS information can be provided from various sources. These sources can be the web browser, the user and the author.

JavaScript- JavaScript s a high-level, interpreted scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.
Bootstrap: Front-end framework Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.


 Feasibility study:
	Being a blog website it have a little hosting cost. Since the system doesn’t consist of any multimedia data transfer, bandwidth required for this is very low.
	Bug fixes and maintaining tasks will have an associated cost.
Resources that are required for the project-
	Programming device (Laptop)
	Hosting Space (freely available) 
	Programming tools (freely available.
    From above points it is clear that the project is financially feasible. 


BACK-END MongoDB NoSQL:
MongoDB is an example of such type. Key-Value stores: Here, each unstructured data is stored with a key for recognizing it. Graph stores: In this type of database, data is stored mostly for networked data. It helps to relate data based on some existing data. Handle large volumes of data at high speed with a scale-out architecture.



•	Store unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data.
•	Enable easy updates to schemas and fields.
•	Be developer-friendly.
•	Take full advantage of the cloud to deliver zero downtime.

Example of how data is stored:
 





Technologies & Operating Environment

The online blogging system web application will operate with the following Web Browsers:
Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.



•	They have higher scalability.
•	They use distributed computing.
•	They are cost effective.
•	They support flexible schema.
•	They're able to process both unstructured and semi-structured data.
•	There are no complex relationships, such as the ones between tables in an RDBMS.

Future Enhancement

This project was developed to fulfil the requirement of common blogging platform for educational purposes. However, there are lots of scope to improve the performance of the Online Blogging Systemin the area of user interface, database performance, and queryp rocessing time etc. So there are many things for future enhancement of this project. The future enhancements that are possible in the project are as follows:

	This time we will add more functions to the web like Interview experience, company experience.
	User can directly write their own blog without login or signup.
	Add new UI/UX designs to improve experience for the users.





Conclusion:

While developing this system a conscious effort has been made to create and develop package, making use of available tools, technologies and resources- that would generate a proper system for cases.
While making this system, an eye has been kept on making it user-friendly. As such one may hope that the system will be acceptable to any user and will adequately meet his/her needs. As in case of any system development process where there are number of short coming, there have been some shortcomings in the development of this system also.
